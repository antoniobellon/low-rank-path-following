THIS IS HOW TO CREATE equation (C-lambdaA)Y in a proper matrix form
for r in range(3):
...     a=np.block([[a,np.zeros((4*(r+1),4))],[np.zeros((4,4*(r+1))),k]])

NB We use an ordering on the nXrank entries of Y, that is we vectorize wrt columns!

NB I am implementing the system with the fact 2 before H and G

NB in the implementation I use the minus "-" sign for the multipliers in the lagrangian
